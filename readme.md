# Project 1 - Network Finger
This is a simple warm-up project for a Computer Networks class. The assignment is to implement a client and server for passing finger data back and forth.

## usage
Compile with the makefile. Run fingerserver and pass in an argument for a port to listen on. Run fingerclient an arbitrary number of times, passing in one argument formatted like so: username@hostname:<port> - example: thornee1@cs1.seattleu.edu:10221
